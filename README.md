Midterm Submission:

Problem statement-
Use deep reinforcement learning (RL) to optimise stock trading strategy and thus maximise investment return.
Explain one of the RL algorithms, such as DQN or DDPG. Include the theory behind it, core concepts, limitations, and advantages. Also, solve the inverted pendulum problem using DQN instead of DDPG, write up its code, and explain how it works in detail.
Make a 3-5 min video explaining the contribution and findings of each group member on the topic.

Endterm Submission:

Problem statement-
Use deep reinforcement learning (RL) to optimise stock trading strategy and thus maximise investment return
Develop reinforcement learning (RL) and benchmark models utilising either ARIMA or LSTM approaches, and conduct a comprehensive performance analysis encompassing both returns and risk factors. 
Evaluate these models using the past 6 weeks of Nifty100 data. Provide a code implementation (using a programming language of your choice) along with a write-up comprising essential literature references, an outline of the methodology employed, a description of the data utilised, and a presentation of the obtained results.
Make a 10-12 min video explaining the contribution and findings of each group member on the topic.
